> Customizable Economies with own symbols, names, icons and more.

## üí∏ **Break Free from Single-Currencies.**
Novaconomy gives you the freedom to create **multiple** economies of your own choice, just like in real life!
With the freedom to have your own symbols, icons, conversion rates, and even interest, you'll have all you need to have a proper Economy!

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">üììChangelog</h2>

### üí∞ 1.4.0 Update: "It's High Noon"
- New Features:
  - Created custom Tax Events, callable from "/taxevent" command (requires `novaconomy.admin.tax_event`)
  - Created Balance Leaderboards
  - Created Bounties on Players
  - Created a user /createcheck command for withdrawing money into item form
    - /economy createcheck is an **admin command** that does not withdraw money from the player 
- Bug Fixes:
  - Messages are now stored in the JAR and can be deleted in the plugin folder
  - Fixed Inventory Interaction where Items can be taken out
  - Fixed Case-Insensitive Modifier Names and ones with Multiple Economies
  - Optimization & Performance Improvements, Code Cleanup

  - Exclude Entities, Death Causes, Blocks, or Materials in Natural Causes

### üè¶ 1.3.0 Update: Banks, Bugs n' Betters
- Created Banks and Taxes, a global currency holder that players can deposit and withdraw from (configurable for min/maxxes), as well as mandatory or optional taxes.
- Fixed MANY BUGS, such as non-ID meta-having items (i.e. enchanted items) getting stuck in inventories, interest being available to users (yikes), and so many more.
- Added Modifiers for Natural Causes, allowing you to override certain death causes, materials broken, and entities killed with your own.
- Economies can no longer have the same symbol (you might get a "This Economy already exists" error if you try to create a new one with the same symbol as an existing one).
- Optimized, Bug Fixed, and ready to go!

### üìà 1.2.0 Update: Business is Boomin
Capitalism at its finest: Create, sell, and capitalize on your own merchandise! Create up to 28 products with
